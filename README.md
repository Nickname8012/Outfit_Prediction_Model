## Project Overview

### Outfit Prediction Model

The **Outfit Prediction Model** project aims to assist users in selecting the best outfit combinations by predicting suitable shirt, tie, and shoe colors based on the input blazer and pant colors. This machine learning model utilizes the power of Random Forest Classifiers to analyze color patterns and make personalized recommendations.

The project is built using Python, leveraging the capabilities of libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and label encoding techniques. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing various color combinations, and it predicts the most complementary shirt, tie, and shoe colors for a given blazer and pant color input.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Target Prediction**: Simultaneously predicts shirt, tie, and shoe colors based on blazer and pant colors.
- **Label Encoding**: Encodes categorical color data to numerical values for model training.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Utilizes Random Forest Classifiers for robust and accurate predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple function to predict outfit colors given user input.

### How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is loaded and color data is encoded into numerical values.
2. **Model Training**: Separate Random Forest Classifiers are trained for predicting shirt, tie, and shoe colors.
3. **Prediction**: The model takes blazer and pant color input, encodes the values, and predicts the most suitable shirt, tie, and shoe colors.
4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using classification reports for accuracy and reliability.

### Example Use Case
Imagine you have a navy blazer and gray pants but are unsure which shirt, tie, and shoes to wear. By inputting these colors into the model, it predicts the best combination for you, enhancing your style and confidence effortlessly.

This project not only simplifies the decision-making process for daily outfits but also showcases the potential of machine learning in fashion and personal styling.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance the model further to suit different styles and preferences.
